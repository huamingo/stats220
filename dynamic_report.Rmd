library(tidyverse)

## Summary Statistics

```{r}
paste("Number of observations:", nrow(latest_data))
```

```{r}
paste("Average number of dogs seen:", round(mean(latest_data$dog_count), 1))
```

## Bar Chart: Number of Dogs Seen

```{r}
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = dog_count)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Dogs Seen per Observation", x = "Dog Count", y = "Frequency")
```

## Bar Chart: Dog Types Seen

```{r}
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = dog_type)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Most Commonly Seen Dog Types", x = "Dog Type", y = "Count")
```

## Dynamic Comments

```{r}
paste("The most common dog type recorded was:", names(which.max(table(latest_data$dog_type))))
```

```{r}
paste("The maximum number of dogs seen in a single observation was:", max(latest_data$dog_count))
```

```

## What's going on with this data?

You need to change the contents of this Rmd! Replace the R code and markdown give below in this template document.

```{r}
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "turtle", "rabbit")
best_pet <- pets[1]

```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
